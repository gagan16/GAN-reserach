# Quality Assessment of GenerativeAdversarial Networks

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been considered as one of the promising approachesin deep learning, it generate fake images with the same statistics as the training set. Although dif-ferent GANs have been proposed for different image analysis tasks, including image generation,semi-supervised learning, and image-to-image translation, their quality assessment has remainedchallenging and so there is no way to compare their visual performance. In this context, this reportconducts the experiments using six different GANs on six different databases to generate fake im-ages. The generated images are then assessed using several no-reference image quality metrics tocompare the performance of the GANs in generating fake images.  The experimental results alsoreveal interesting properties of the examined GAN, notably regarding the different datasets andmetric function



### Prerequisites

* Python, NumPy, TensorFlow, SciPy, Matplotlib, pillow, Keras, Tensorboard
* Better if you have a GPU



### Installing
